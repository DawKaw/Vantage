Davis Vantage VUE Weather Station

This program allows you to download data direct from your Davis Vantage weather station via local network. This program is helpful when we need to create a shell script that is to forward the data to, for example, some database.
The program was tested on Davis Vantage VUE device with ethernet module inserted into base station.
